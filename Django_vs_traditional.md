###### my CREATE TABLE statements in SQL

## Here is my Django code making the same database

###### my ER diagram made in PG Admin

## Reflection
- The PG Admin ERD is much more clear; however, I still like the handmade one. I feel as if the handmade one serves more of a purpose because I visualize what my Schema will look like before making my tables. In my opinion, the handmade ERD is just as functional as the Pg Admin, but if I am working with multiple people I would try to get the PG Admin ERD. 

- I believe that individually they both took the same amount of effort. Although, setting up the Django orm and logging into PG Admin took more knowledge and time to navigate. If I were to do it again I would make a handmade ERD and use django. I prefer writing out my ERD, and django and PG Admin are way more powerful than simply writing SQL in the vim.
