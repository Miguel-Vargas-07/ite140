    <h3>Library Database</h3>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    - create a library database<br>
    - create a view<br>
    - create a pivot table & pivot chart using the view
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    The purpose of creating and selecting portions of a database to 
    be filtered out is to store all data, and to be able to quickly 
    answer questions about the data inside the database that
    are asked most frequently.
    
    <h3>ER Diagram</h3> 

    - This diagram represents 6 entities(tables),  including one join table<br>
    - The book_author table serves as a joint between the book and author in order
     to maintain <a href = "database_normalization.html">normal form</a> in the 
     event that a book has mutliple authors or vice versa.<br><br>

     <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src = "../images/library_ER_Diagram copy.jpg" alt = "library ER diagram" style = "width:60%;" style = "display: block;"><br><br>
     </div>


     Once I completed the ER diagram, I wrote the code to create the new tables, 
     <a href = "https://github.com/Miguel-Vargas-07/ite140/blob/main/create_tables_library.sql">Click here</a> to see this code in my repo.<br>
    
    <h3>Mock Data</h3>

    After creating all of the tables, the next step is to insert some data in order to be able to manipulate the database. 
    For this, I used <a href = "https://www.mockaroo.com/">mockaroo</a> to create a bunch of "insert into" statements that
    would fill the tables with values in order to run queries on the tables. 
    Here is a snippet of what those insert statements would look like<br><br>

  
    <h3>View</h3>
    
    With the mock data, I can now create a view. A <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_(SQL)">view</a> 
    is a pre selected filter that creates a table with 
    filtered values. The view that I chose to make is one that grabs the expiration date of a library card alongside the user info relevant to 
    that card. I chose this because I believe it would be in the best interest of the library to notify the users that they must renew their card in 
    order to keep the community happy. Views like this allow for improtant data like this to not just be stored in a table, but to 
    be readily accessible to whomever needs to access it. <br><br>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src = "../images/View_table_terminal copy.jpg" alt = "view table" style = "width:65%;"><br><br>
    </div>

    <h3>Python Script</h3>
    
    Now that I created my database and made a view to go along with it, the next thing to do is play 
    with the view in Excel. In order to do this, I used <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and 
    PowerQuery to make a live connection between my database and an excel sheet. The pandas extension allows me to import my 
    database, while PowerQuery gives excel access to the document. <br><br>


    <h3>Excel</h3>

    Once the view was imported into excel, I made a pivot table and pivot chart to further analyze the selected data. 
    This illustrated and further clarified what the data in the view meant. This pivot chart takes the library cards and 
    who they belong to from the view, and shows that from that pool of library cards, which ones are set to expire by 2026. 
    This can be very useful becasue it would allow the library to send out reminders to the users whom need to revalidate their library
    card soon. <br><br>
    
    <div style = "text-align: center;">
    <img src = "../images/Pivot_Data copy.jpg" alt = "pivot data" style = "width:65%;"><br><br>
    </div>

    <h3>Takeaway</h3>

    The main purpose of this project was to design, create, customize, export, and analyze a database meant for a library. This project showed 
    many aspects of a database, and how it is not just a place to store data. A database is more capable than jsut that, it allows for analyses, 
    organization, and efficient retrieval of information, making it a powerful tool for managing complex networks.
