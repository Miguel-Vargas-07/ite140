    <h3>Database Normalization project</h3>

    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
    This project is meant to explore the concept of database normalization using <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms">normal form</a>.
    Normal form is tier of 7 levels that each has more specific rules a database should follow in order to be able to
    say it is in normal form. This set of rules ensures that
    the data in the table is well organized and ready for usage.

    <h3>Sample table</h3>
    The following table is the sample table that is not in normal form <br><br>

    <div style = "text-align: center;">
    <img src = "../images/original_table.jpg" alt = "original table" style="width:80%;"><br><br>
    </div>

    in order to make this table follow normnal form I had to first make two sub tables that would link back to the main 
    table on one row called the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary key</a>. The primary key is 
    a row where each value is unique that allows for tables to cross reference each other. By making a sub table for customer 
    and sale information, the table is now more organized and will not have repeating data. This is important in order to follow 
    normal form because a rule in 1st normal form is that you must eliminate repeating groups.  <br><br>
    
    <h3>Sub Tables</h3>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="../images/sub_table_items.jpg" alt="items sub table" style="width:40%; display: inline-block; margin-right: 10px;">
        <img src="../images/sub_table_customerinfo.jpg" alt="customer sub table" style="width:40%; display: inline-block;">
      </div><br><br>

    By making both of these sub tables, the rows left from the original now follow normal form. This is because <br>there aren't
     any repeating values, each row is unique, and the order of the rows doesn't matter. 

    <h3>Final table</h3>

    This final table and its sub tables follow normal form and are ready to handle real data.<br><br>
    
    <div style = "text-align: center;">
    <img src = "../images/final_table.jpg" alt = "final table" style = "width:70%;"><br><br>
    </div>

    <h3>Takeaway</h3>     

    The main purpose of this project was to properly set up and organize a database. This is important because if a database is unable to 
    follow normal form, it will struggle or fail to add or remove data into its tables. By following normal form, a database is fully 
    functioning and ready to be deployed and used by whomever, while it is also easy to read and manipulate.
